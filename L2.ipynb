        "This lab focuses on:\n",
        "- Breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks (task decomposition)\n",
        "- Defining specialized agents with clear roles and responsibilities  \n",
        "- Choosing appropriate multi-agent design patterns\n",

            "Summary judgment\n",
            "- The Implementer’s Step 1 draft correctly follows the Planner’s instructions: it defines product family, lists representative SKUs, sets region/currency (USD, US retailers), and lists the three buyer personas and the 12‑month sentiment timeframe. It also offers sensible options for live data access (A/B/C) and asks the user to confirm scope. This is aligned with the Planner’s Step 1 acceptance criteria.\n",
            "\n",
            "Gaps, clarifications and suggested improvements (specific, actionable)\n",
            "1. Benchmark sources (Step 3 prep)\n",
            "   - Suggest the Implementer explicitly confirm the benchmark sources to use so the user knows the methodology up front. Recommended defaults to include: TechPowerUp, GamersNexus, Tom’s Hardware, AnandTech, NotebookCheck (where relevant), UL 3DMark, Blender (classroom scenes), Blender BMW/Classroom, DaVinci Resolve, and SPECviewperf or representative synthetic compute benchmarks.\n",
            "   - Action: add a line in the scope confirming these benchmark sources and ask user to accept or modify.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Customer review aggregation threshold (Step 4 realism)\n",
            "   - Planner requires \"at least 200 aggregated reviews per major SKU OR explanation if sample size is smaller.\" The Implementer should preemptively state a fallback policy: if fewer than 200 reviews exist across target sources within 12 months, they will aggregate all available reviews, report sample size, and flag lower confidence in the sentiment score.\n",
            "   - Action: add this fallback policy and the confidence labeling (High/Medium/Low).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Memory/configuration variants and aftermarket models\n",
            "   - Some SKUs have multiple memory configurations or factory OC variants (e.g., region-specific 12GB/16GB versions). The scope does not mention how to handle variants. Recommend clarifying whether to treat each memory/configuration variant separately or aggregate as a single SKU.\n",
            "   - Action: ask user whether to include each notable variant separately (and include model-specific MSRP).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Last‑gen models & used/resale market\n",
            "   - The Planner’s Step 5 (value comparisons) can benefit from last‑gen or used-market comparisons (often strong value). Ask whether to include a small set of last‑gen models (e.g., RTX 30‑series / RX 6000 series) and whether to include used/resale marketplace prices (e.g., eBay).\n",
            "   - Action: ask user to confirm inclusion of last‑gen / used prices.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Retailer list & price-sampling window (Step 2 detail)\n",
            "   - Implementer listed retailers generically. Recommend specifying exact retailers and whether to include marketplace sellers on Amazon, used listings, and price snapshot frequency. Also confirm the time window for price snapshots (single timestamp vs 7‑day median).\n",
            "   - Action: propose using Newegg, Amazon (new only), Best Buy, Micro Center, and the manufacturers’ stores, and ask whether to use single-timestamp or median-over-7-days pricing.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. AI/ML persona decision\n",
            "   - The Implementer asked whether to include AI/ML users. Recommend making this explicit: if Yes, specify what workloads matter (inference vs training, model sizes, frameworks). If No, confirm omission.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Feature weighting for value metric (Step 5)\n",
            "   - The Planner expects an adjusted value metric (performance/price, adjusted for ray tracing/AI features and customer satisfaction). The Implementer should ask whether the user prefers a particular weighting scheme (equal weight for perf/price, or heavier for performance for high-end gamers, heavier for stability/driver for content creators).\n",
            "   - Action: propose a default weighting and ask for confirmation (e.g., Mainstream: 70% price/perf, 20% customer satisfaction, 10% features; High-end: 60% perf, 25% features (ray tracing/AI), 15% satisfaction; Content creators: 50% compute perf, 30% driver/CUDA ecosystem, 20% price/perf).\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Timestamping and normalization\n",
            "   - Reinforce that every price point and benchmark citation will be timestamped and normalized to USD; if any prices or reviews are unavailable, the Implementer should include explicit “unavailable” notes.\n",
            "   - Action: add a confirmation line for this.\n",
            "\n",
            "Decision / approval\n",
            "- The Implementer’s Step 1 is complete and appropriate as a user-facing scope-and-clarification message, but it should incorporate the 8 clarifications above to reduce back-and-forth and ensure Steps 2–6 meet the Planner’s acceptance criteria without rework.\n",
            "\n",
            "Approve status\n",

Do you want me to proceed with the representative SKUs listed, or should I use a narrower list (e.g., only midrange and high-end), or include last-gen models for value comparisons?\\n\\nNext action after your confirmation\\n- If you confirm scope and choose option A (provisional) I will run Steps 2–6 using mid‑2024 reference data and explicitly label where I’m using older data and what would change with live prices.\\n- If you choose B or C, I’ll provide the data-gathering artifacts (retailer list, exact queries, spreadsheet template or scripts) and then produce the full live-data analysis once data is available.\\n\\nPlease reply with your choices for 1–4 (or say “accept defaults and use provisional data”) and I’ll proceed.\\n\\nIMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(id='60c4328a-7522-4743-a186-4459c051e772', source='Critic', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=2166, completion_tokens=2189), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 10, 1, 22, 55, 44, 56441, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='Summary judgment\\n- The Implementer’s Step 1 draft correctly follows the Planner’s instructions: it defines product family, lists representative SKUs, sets region/currency (USD, US retailers), and lists the three buyer personas and the 12‑month sentiment timeframe. It also offers sensible options for live data access (A/B/C) and asks the user to confirm scope. This is aligned with the Planner’s Step 1 acceptance criteria.\\n\\nGaps, clarifications and suggested improvements (specific, actionable)\\n1. Benchmark sources (Step 3 prep)\\n   - Suggest the Implementer explicitly confirm the benchmark sources to use so the user knows the methodology up front. Recommended defaults to include: TechPowerUp, GamersNexus, Tom’s Hardware, AnandTech, NotebookCheck (where relevant), UL 3DMark, Blender (classroom scenes), Blender BMW/Classroom, DaVinci Resolve, and SPECviewperf or representative synthetic compute benchmarks.\\n   - Action: add a line in the scope confirming these benchmark sources and ask user to accept or modify.\\n\\n2. Customer review aggregation threshold (Step 4 realism)\\n   - Planner requires \"at least 200 aggregated reviews per major SKU OR explanation if sample size is smaller.\" The Implementer should preemptively state a fallback policy: if fewer than 200 reviews exist across target sources within 12 months, they will aggregate all available reviews, report sample size, and flag lower confidence in the sentiment score.\\n   - Action: add this fallback policy and the confidence labeling (High/Medium/Low).\\n\\n3. Memory/configuration variants and aftermarket models\\n   - Some SKUs have multiple memory configurations or factory OC variants (e.g., region-specific 12GB/16GB versions). The scope does not mention how to handle variants. Recommend clarifying whether to treat each memory/configuration variant separately or aggregate as a single SKU.\\n   - Action: ask user whether to include each notable variant separately (and include model-specific MSRP).\\n\\n4. Last‑gen models & used/resale market\\n   - The Planner’s Step 5 (value comparisons) can benefit from last‑gen or used-market comparisons (often strong value). Ask whether to include a small set of last‑gen models (e.g., RTX 30‑series / RX 6000 series) and whether to include used/resale marketplace prices (e.g., eBay).\\n   - Action: ask user to confirm inclusion of last‑gen / used prices.\\n\\n5. Retailer list & price-sampling window (Step 2 detail)\\n   - Implementer listed retailers generically. Recommend specifying exact retailers and whether to include marketplace sellers on Amazon, used listings, and price snapshot frequency. Also confirm the time window for price snapshots (single timestamp vs 7‑day median).\\n   - Action: propose using Newegg, Amazon (new only), Best Buy, Micro Center, and the manufacturers’ stores, and ask whether to use single-timestamp or median-over-7-days pricing.\\n\\n6. AI/ML persona decision\\n   - The Implementer asked whether to include AI/ML users. Recommend making this explicit: if Yes, specify what workloads matter (inference vs training, model sizes, frameworks). If No, confirm omission.\\n\\n7. Feature weighting for value metric (Step 5)\\n   - The Planner expects an adjusted value metric (performance/price, adjusted for ray tracing/AI features and customer satisfaction). The Implementer should ask whether the user prefers a particular weighting scheme (equal weight for perf/price, or heavier for performance for high-end gamers, heavier for stability/driver for content creators).\\n   - Action: propose a default weighting and ask for confirmation (e.g., Mainstream: 70% price/perf, 20% customer satisfaction, 10% features; High-end: 60% perf, 25% features (ray tracing/AI), 15% satisfaction; Content creators: 50% compute perf, 30% driver/CUDA ecosystem, 20% price/perf).\\n\\n8. Timestamping and normalization\\n   - Reinforce that every price point and benchmark citation will be timestamped and normalized to USD; if any prices or reviews are unavailable, the Implementer should include explicit “unavailable” notes.\\n   - Action: add a confirmation line for this.\\n\\nDecision / approval\\n- The Implementer’s Step 1 is complete and appropriate as a user-facing scope-and-clarification message, but it should incorporate the 8 clarifications above to reduce back-and-forth and ensure Steps 2–6 meet the Planner’s acceptance criteria without rework.\\n\\nApprove status\\n- APPROVED (with the above suggested clarifications to be added before proceeding to Steps 2–6).', type='TextMessage')], stop_reason=\"Text 'APPROVED' mentioned\")"

In our tasks that we made up, we did not thoroughly specify the output format, and it seems as though the model struggled on these. In our Shrek scenario, the critic was not satisfied with the implementer's performance. In the AMD vs Nvidia prompt, the implementer did not execute the planner's plan fully, but instead asked for clarification. Somehow the critic was satisfied with the implementer's output.\n",

        "The system may be more affective if the agents were able to rerun their processes as requested if a later agent requests it (for example, when the implementer asks for clarification, the planner should be able to clarify. Another example is if the critic is not satisfied, the implementer should be able to rework it's solution given the feedback). This would allow for the system to always produce complete and satisfactory responses (if such a response is possible). If each agent was able to also be more concise, that would likely improve performance as well."
